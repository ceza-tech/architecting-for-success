## Challenge 04 - Automated Governance Reporting (1hr)

In this challenge you will be implementing [AzGovViz](https://github.com/JulianHayward/Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting) which is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure TenantÂ´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more.

>Since Azure Resource Manager sometimes caches configurations and data to improve performance, it can sometimes take up to 30 minutes for changes to take effect when you assign roles or remove role assignments.

## Challenge 04 - Success criteria:

1. Take your time and read the setup guide. And read the note above! If you need to create new identities and assign roles do it now.
2. Setup AzGovViz with GitHub Actions using OIDC.
3. Publishing the AzGovViz HTML to an Azure Web App.
4. Export to CSV your PSRule results.
