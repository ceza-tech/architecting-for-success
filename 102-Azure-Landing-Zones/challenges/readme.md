- Circa 75 VMs for Prod, less than 20 for Dev / Test.
- COVID-19 triggered a heavy investment in their online presence which is now one of the key revenue stream for the business.

- They have dedicated 10.0.0.0/16 as the IP address space for all networks in Azure.

### Requirements

- The first workload to be migrated to Azure is the SAP production landscape; migration must be completed in less than 6 weeks due to capacity and reliability issues with their datacenters. Customer recently experienced capacity-related outages which resulted in unexpected downtime and data loss.
- They want to be able to easily create cost-related reports for each workload based on department, owner, and environment.
- They want to minimize their existing on-premises footprint and want to replace the existing MPLS solution with a 'cloud-based' approach.
- They want to start allowing local internet breakout from all sites to improve SaaS application performance and reduce the load on their WAN.

- They require separate Production, Staging & Development environments for security, agility and cost purposes. But they do not want to have development environments and associated VNETs to be able to communicate with production. Also, developers must granted "unrestricted" access to development environments at scale with minimal administrative overhead.
- All production VMs must be backed up, and some selected VMs in dev/test environments also need to be protected.
- They require built-in platform regulatory compliance security checks and reporting for all production environments (PCI-DSS, ISO27001, CIS etc.)
  - ISO27001 for all environments except Sandbox subscriptions.
  - PCI-DSS for the SAP and payment system.

- TDE & Auditing should be enforced on all Azure SQL Databases.
- Azure Monitor VM Insights should be enabled on all VMs and any required agents automatically installed.
- No Public IP Addresses are allowed in the environment except for core network functionality, sandbox environments, and online applications.
- They should receive alerts related to abnornmal consumption, cost overruns, etc.
