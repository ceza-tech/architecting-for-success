# Architecting for Success

# Azure Landing Zones

## Overview

Successful cloud adoption is built on the strong foundations of the Cloud Adoption Framework Ready methodology. But what the hack is an Azure landing zone?

Simply put, a landing zone is a multi-subscription Azure environment for hosting workloads, pre-provisioned through code. Out-of-the-box it accounts for scale, security, governance, networking, and identity. It  enables application migration, modernization, and innovation at enterprise-scale for all customers irrespective of size in Azure. This approach considers all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio and doesn't differentiate between infrastructure as a service or platform as a service.
