## Success criteria

## Design an Azure Landing Zone architecture which meets the customer's requirements

Your design should include:

1. Details about minimum requirements and information you need have at hand to deploy ALZ accelerator. Think of tenants, subscriptions, privileged identities, security contacts, IP addresses, etc.
2. A management group hierarchy including subscription organization
3. A list of the required Azure Policy (built-in & custom) policies or initiatives including scope assignments
4. A list of RBAC assignment
5. A network topology



Think about the following:

1. What will you use to help the customer easily create cost-related reports for each workload based on department, owner, and environment? And how will you apply it?
2. How will you implement the customer's regulatory & compliance requirements?
3. How are you going to make sure that M-Series and L-Series VMs can only be deployed in the SAP environments without impacting agility and scale?
4. How will you ensure that "development environments and associated VNETs are not able to communicate with production"?
5. How will you assign develops access to development environments at scale and with minimal administrative effort?
