# Azure Landing Zones for OpenAI (works in progress)

![Azure AI Landing Zone](AIArchitecture.png "Azure AI Landing Zone")

This GitHub repository, which is based on the amazing work done by @FreddyAyala, provides a challenge-based workshop which will allow you to design an Azure AI Landing Zone â€” a tailored environment which will allow customers to accelerate their adoption of OpenAI services like GPT-4 and DALL-E.

**Optionally** This landing zone can also be designed to complement and integrate with existing data management and data landing zones within the [cloud-scale data analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/) platform, enabling customers to unlock the true potential of their data thru AI.

## Customer Needs

Customers exploring Azure OpenAI services like GPT-4 and DALL-E have the following needs:

- Private: OpenAI services and other supporting services must be deployed in their own tenant.
- Compliant: Data must only reside in the regions which they specify.
- Isolated: Network traffic must be isolated from other services but still be able to easily connect to other internal services hosted either in Azure or on-premises.
- Secure: Use built-in enterprise grade authentication security features.
- Resilient: Deploy services across multiple regions to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
- Consumer Friendly: Provide a familiar user experience and the added capabilities of chatting over the internet.

## Architecture Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Connect privately to App Service and OpenAI services
### Scenario 2: Securely expose App Service to the internet with Application Gateway and WAF
### Scenario 3: Multi-Region Chatbot with Azure Front Door

### Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure Open AI

In this workshop we will be using the [Azure Chat Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat/tree/main) to deploy a private Azure OpenAI powered chatbot in your Azure Subscription, with a familiar user experience and the added capabilities of chatting over your data and files.
